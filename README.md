# gitlab-docker-ci

[GitLab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-ci/) runner with access to host Docker daemon. PHP-focused.

## Motivation

Test your code, ideally Docker containers themselves, inside a Dockerized GitLab CI runner.
Use the host node's Docker daemon, creating "sibling" containers.

Why not re-use one of the existing images out there?
You'll notice this project helps harmonize the host's `docker` group gid with the container.
We don't wholesale re-install Docker client in the container when adding some libraries will do.
And writing my own let me understand the tech, better. :-)

### Docker Engine/Docker Compose version

The `Dockerfile` contains variables for specifying particular versions of Engine and Compose;
you may need to adjust the Engine version in particular to match your cloud provider's
current version. At time of writing, that was 1.9.1 for Docker Cloud, though 1.10+
has been available for some time. You may need to fork and adjust the `Dockerfile`
to meet your needs.

### PHP-focused

I mostly work in PHP, so it's helpful to install a few tools like composer.

## Usage

Edit the included `docker-compose.yml` file with your registration data, then run `docker-compose up`.

Uncomment the volume mount for `/etc/gitlab-runner` if you wish to mount and re-use an existing config.

Or, build the Dockerfile and run the image using your favorite orchestration tool.
